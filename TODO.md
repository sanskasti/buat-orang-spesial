# TODO List for Apology Website Project

## Project Overview

Create a web-based apology website with 7 slides. Slides 1 and 2 act as password inputs. Include funny backgrounds, music, and additional backgrounds.

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Create main HTML file (index.html) with structure for 7 slides, password inputs on slides 1 and 2, and audio element for music.
- [x] Create CSS file (styles.css) for funny and cute backgrounds, slide styling, and responsive design.
- [x] Create JavaScript file (script.js) to handle slide navigation, password validation, and music controls.
- [x] Add funny background images or patterns (e.g., emojis, cute animals) via CSS or inline.
- [x] Add typing effect to text in slides for better user experience.
- [x] Add transition effects between slides for smooth navigation.
- [x] Test the website by opening index.html in a browser to ensure slides work, passwords unlock, and music plays.
- [x] Final review and adjustments based on testing.

## Notes

- Passwords: Slide 1 could require entering "maaf" (sorry in Indonesian), Slide 2 something like "aku sayang kamu" (I love you).
- Backgrounds: Use CSS gradients, emojis, or simple SVG for cuteness.
- Music: Embed a public audio URL or assume a file; use loop for background music.
